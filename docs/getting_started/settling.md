### New Students Moving from Another State/Country <a name="slr"></a>
It's important that you establish California residency early in your first semester. If you don't complete the necessary tasks on time, you will be classified as a out-of-state student for the following academic year which results in higher tuition costs. Although the deadline for filing your Statement of Legal Residence (SLR) is in June, you must complete all necessary conditions for residency (getting your CA drivers license, registering your car in CA, etc) **before the end of your first semester.**
