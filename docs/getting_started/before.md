# Before You Arrive

A member of the Persson Group Onboarding Team will reach out before your expected start date to share this group handbook and coordinate other onboarding efforts to welcome you to the Persson Group. Although many things can only be taken care of after arriving, here are a few simple things you can do in advance. 

If you have not been contacted by the Persson Group Onboarding Team at least one week before your arrival, please reach out to Christian  Legaspi and Ann Rutt (contact information is on the Persson Group website in Useful Quick Links below). We do our best, but there may have been a miscommunication or oversight on our end if no one has not reached out two weeks before your expected start date.

## Work Scope and Hiring Details

Several administrative and research details in onboarding are uniquie to each group member. Some of this information may have been communicated during your hiring process, but please reach out to Kristin (or members of the Persson Group Onboarding Team) if you are unsure about any of the following questions before your arrival:

* What project(s) will I be working on? 
* What funding source will support my work? 
* Will I be hired as a UC Berkeley employee (and LBL affiliate) or LBL employee?
* Which subgroup(s) will I be joining? Who will I be working most closely with? 

Many administrative matters (HR orientation, payroll, purchasing, etc.) will vary depending on if you are a UC Berkeley or LBL employee. This information which help you navigate joining the Persson Group such as understanding which administrative systems you will use and who can help you become orientated with your research/work.

## Human Resources Orientation

As mentioned above, the HR processes and orientation will vary depending on whether your financial support will come from UC Berkeley or LBL controlled funding sources. Please refer to the relevant information below depending on your situation.

### LBL Employees
* There are a few steps that must be completed before your LBL new hire orientation can be scheduled (completing a formal application, background check, etc.). Contact Alice Muller with any questions or status update requests for matters on the Persson Group end during this time.
* Once everything has been successfully processed, you should recieve an email from LBL HR regarding an in person new hire appointment with a general national lab orientation and to complete new hire paperwork. This appointment is held at the national lab and further instructions will be sent regarding location, accessing the lab, and getting your badge afterwards.

### UC Berkeley Employees
* Once your hiring paperwork with UC Berkeley has been processed, you should recieve an email regarding an in person new hire appointment with UC Berkeley HR to complete new hire paperwork. 
* See [Obtaining Your Cal 1 Card at https://cal1card.berkeley.edu/](https://cal1card.berkeley.edu/) for information on how to get your Cal1 card (which serves as an ID card for UC Berkeley). Postdocs will need to wait until after your new hire paperwork meeting to go to the Cal1 Card Office. 
* For information on setting-up your CalNet ID [click here](https://calnetweb.berkeley.edu/calnet-me/information-new-users). Your CalNet ID is used for authentification for UC Berkeley resources. Postdocs will need to wait until after their UC Berkeley new hire paperwork has been processed before they can activate their CalNet ID.
* Proceed to follow the instructions for LBL Affiliates. Due to Kristin's joint appointment, all graduate students and postdocs hired through UC Berkeley also have LBL Affiliate status to access the group's offices and resources at the national lab.

### LBL Affiliates
* On the Persson Group end, a LBL Affiliate appointment must be processed by Alice Muller before you can obtain your LBL badge.
* Once your appointment has been processed, you will recieve email instructions from LBL for getting your LBL badge and setting up your LDAP account (used for authentification for national lab resources). Unlike LBL employees, no in person orientation with LBL is required.
* If your start date is coming up soon, but you have not recieved any email instructions from LBL, contact Alice Muller asking for an update on the status of your affiliate appointment.

## Order a Computer 

Most long-term appointments (graduate student, postdoc, staff) involve purchasing a new computer. It typically takes at least 2 weeks for a computer to arrive. To avoid delays once you start from waiting to recieve your computer, you can make arrangements to order one in advance. Work with Alice Muller to handle the purchase (your access to purchasing resources is granted after your arrival). Visit the [Getting a Computer](/getting_started/buy_computer.md) section of the handbook for group guidelines on computer selection and purchasing.

Short-term appointments (undergraduate students, internships, etc.) will not involve a computer purchase unless otherwise stated. Instead, an excellent computer can be borrowed from the group’s inventory.
