## About the Group <a name="about"></a>

Our group studies the physics and chemistry of materials using atomistic computational methods and high-performance computing technology. Most of our research is focused on materials for energy applications, such as battery electrode materials, electrolytes, photocatalysts, thermoelectrics, etc. We are co-located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and the University of California, Berkeley, just down the hill from LBNL. Our main workspaces are located at LBNL, but we have a number of additional desks available on campus for students to use in between classes, which are located in the grad bay of Hearst Memorial Mining Building. San Francisco is located across the bay from Berkeley and is about a 30 minute drive or BART train ride away. Berkeley itself is a vibrant city of 115,000 people filled with cafes, restaurants of all types, and cultural activities.

## Meetings <a name="meeting"></a>

### Group Meeting <a name="group"></a>
There is a mandatory 1 hr group meeting that occurs approximately every two weeks. At group meeting, one of the group members will give a talk on their research. You will be placed on a rotating [schedule](https://sites.google.com/a/lbl.gov/perssongroup/group-meeting) that will have you present your work about every 1 year.

### Subgroup Meetings <a name="sub"></a>
Given our new additions and growth, we have decided to implement new subgroups, associated leaders, and members. Undergraduate students are welcome to join any subgroup they want, but be aware that subgroup meetings probably can't be moved around to fit undergraduate members' schedules.

The responsibility of subgroup leads is to find a slot where everyone can make bi-weekly meetings and send out calendar calls and reminders. The current subgroups are (leads are in bold):

## Group events

Some of the regular things we do as a group are:

* Lunch every two weeks jointly with our group and members of the Jain research group.

* A group outing once every semester. Past activities included paintball and cardboard boat races in Kristin's pool.

* Twice-yearly “CodeBusters” events, where we spend 3 days hacking on code together.

* Dinners to celebrate group members who are moving on to join universities or companies.

* An annual joint holiday party with the Ceder Group.
